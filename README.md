This is a To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to:

Add tasks

Mark them as completed

Delete tasks

Save their list even after refreshing (using localStorage)

This project uses only vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks) and demonstrates core concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and persistence with local storage.
